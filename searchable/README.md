Searcheable is a basic plugin which defines a first-level tables : **Searchables** and **SearchablesKeyword**.

This plugin is used by the other plugin *Blog*.

A **term** is a word or a few words representing a idea or a concept, e.g. *Git*, *GitHub*, *Distributed Revision Control*

A **keyword** is a strong term linked to others terms, e.g. *Git* is linked with *Distributed Revision Control*

A **searchable** is a extendable model used for searchable objects optionally linked to keywords


In our blog example :

*Git* is a *tag* and also a *keyword*

The post *Git : how to create a repository* is **searchable** and is linked to the tag *Git*
